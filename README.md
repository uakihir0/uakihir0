### Hi there 👋 

I'm passionate about social media and enjoy creating client apps and libraries for them. Whether it's crafting server-side apps with Kotlin or Go, or building iOS and web apps, I'm always eager to dive in! Check out my [portfolio site](https://uakihir0.github.io/) to see what I've created!

(2025) I'm working on creating social media libraries using Kotlin Multiplatform. Additionally, I'm developing [PlanetLink🪐](https://github.com/uakihir0/planetlink), a library that seamlessly handles multiple social media platforms transparently. I hope you'll use it to craft some amazing apps 🙌

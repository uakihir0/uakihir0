### Hi there 👋 

I love social media and enjoy creating client apps and libraries for them. I develop server-side applications using Kotlin or Go, and tailor iOS and web apps according to what I want to create!

Currently, I'm working on creating social media client libraries using Kotlin Multiplatform. Additionally, I'm developing [PlanetLink🪐](https://github.com/uakihir0/planetlink), a library that transparently handles multiple social media platforms, using these libraries. I hope you'll use it to create some amazing apps 🙌 (2024E)
